# Handwritten Mathematical Equation Solver using CNN
 This is a project where I have trained a CNN model to identify digits and operators, and using this model made a program to parse and solve entire maths equations.

 Please note, the notebook was made on google colab and the dataset and the model are both saved in my google drive, so if you decide to replicate this project, please ensure to edit the code to import and use your own dataset in the right places.

I have ensured to make the notebook meticulously documented, and have tried to explain everything I have done with markups and comments throughout the project, trying to provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the code, so I hope it would help anyone, regardless of their familiarity with the topic, understand this project easily. Also, I believe, if you are new to the field of ML, deep learning and CNNs, you would find all the descriptions, definitions and explanations of key concepts I have included helpful. Keep learning ;)

 As this is my first project, it's quite possible that I might have made some mistakes, and there are many thigs I could have done better. I would love to have any feedbacks and suggestions you might have. They would help me a lot to learn and gorw. Thank you!
